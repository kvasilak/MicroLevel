Micro level design issues

* rx/tx swapped to serial debug port
* Resister values for I2C pullup? Dave spec 29.4k, atmel data shaat says 1533 ohms
* CTS line on debug port needs to be Grounded
* Verify UP / Down LED current, may be high
* verify Cal LED current, Maybe too low
* P1 has .5(?)mm pad spacing, while connector has 1mm, they seem to be different styles completely
