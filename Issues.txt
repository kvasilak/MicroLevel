Micro level design issues

Version 3
Hardware
* brightness control, need a way to easily control LED brightness. Dash brightness knob is terrible. Add a pot or button to adjust independently
* mounting holes, inner bottom holes interfere with camp and travel buttons
* Logo LEDs, can they be spread further apart?
* need a way to disable the steering remote
  > Pull down resistors
  > Special build

Software
* Travel adjustment rate, need to slow down to almost never, maybe reduce sample rate to once a minute
* Wake on button press, when sleeping any button press should wake the controller. The controller will then stay awake for a while then sleep
    > Manual, stays awake for 5 minutes after last button press
    > Travel, Stays awake until level is achieved or 5 minutes
    > Camp,   stays awake until level is achieved or 5 minutes
* remove dance 
    
    
Mechanical
* Design front panel
* Design buttons
* Design overlay
* fix issue with sensor mount bracket
    > Mounting hole spacing
    > sensor mounting hole layout
*Find 4 cond wire
   > make custom harness with twisted wires?
  


Version 2 ( Dave M 1st design )
Big things
* rx/tx swapped to serial debug port
* CTS line on debug port needs to be Grounded
* P1 has .5(?)mm pad spacing, while connector has 1mm, they seem to be different styles completely
* rj45 connector doesn't stay in very well, I think the lock tab is hitting the PCB and not locking.
* atmega164 processor only has 16k of memory, should be bigger, 1284 will be used
* board too tall for the dash cutout (I  will design board )
* buttons and camp / travel LEDs should be all on the same PCB as the controller

Minor things
* Verify UP / Down LED current, may be high ( hasn't burnt out yet )
* verify Cal LED current, Maybe too low ( seems bright enough )
* Resister values for I2C pullup? Dave spec 29.4k, atmel data shaat says 1533 ohms
* use 3d printed buttons with surface mount switches for up, down, camp and travel
* solenoid board mounting should be compatible with controller, I.e
* bezel to be laser cut lexan(?) with graphic overlay
* change jtag connector to use smaller connector .050"(?) so I don't need to use the big ugly adapter
* rotate Accel to be square to gravity for more resolution, instead of being at 45' I don't think we need to compensate for drift, I'm not doing it for the z axis
* may need to low pass filter the accelerometer values  in camp mode, test first
