Micro level design issues

* rx/tx swapped to serial debug port
* Resister values for I2C pullup? Dave spec 29.4k, atmel data shaat says 1533 ohms
* CTS line on debug port needs to be Grounded
* Verify UP / Down LED current, may be high
* verify Cal LED current, Maybe too low
* P1 has .5(?)mm pad spacing, while connector has 1mm, they seem to be different styles completely
* atmega164 processoronly has 16k of memory, should be bigger, 1284 will be used
* board too tall for the dash cutout
* use 3d printed buttons
* buttons and camp / travel LEDs should be all on the same PCB as the controller
* solenoid board mounting should be compatible with controller mounting, I.e stackable...
